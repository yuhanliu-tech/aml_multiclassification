# Architected Material Lab: Multiclassification for 3D Printing Error Detection 

## Data Organization Breakdown

Raw Data: 
- Uncompressed, raw images from IDS imaging camera, separated into time frames (May 30 (morning) + June 1 (afternoon) + June 15 (afternoon))

Processed Data (5 Buckets): 
- Images of single extruded line prepared for model to distinguish between 5 error types

Processed Data (3 Buckets): 
- Images of single extruded line prepared for model to distinguish between extrusion types (under, over, normal).

Layer One Data (3 Buckets): 
- Images of single printed layer prepared for model to distinguish between extrusion types.
